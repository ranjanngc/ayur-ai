Several bibliographies and monographs are now ready and their publication will be taken up as and when funds become available. The work of the Board has now been taken over by the National Commission for the History of Sciences in India, inaugurated on January 15, 1965, by Shri M. C. Chagla, the Union Minister of Education. This monograph offers a scientifically classified account of the contents of Caraka Samhita, one of the two earliest and most renowned medical treatises of ancient India. Of these two treatises, Caraka Samhita and Susruta Samhita, dealing respectively with medicine and surgery in the main, Caraka is admittedly the more ancient, though both have passed through repeated recensions by later and more advanced workers. The significance of these treatises lies in the rational basis of their concepts and discourse, and in their adoption of scientific terminology. No definite date, acceptable to all, could however be assigned as to the composition of Caraka Samhita, though its antiquity is not generally challenged. The extant Caraka is a redaction by Drdhabala of the genuine Caraka Samhita, which was itself a redaction by Caraka of the original work of Agnivega, a disciple of Atreya Punarvasu—a teacher in the University of Taxila during the age of Buddha. Caraka has been identified by some scholars with a physician of the same name in the court of the Indo-Scythian king Kaniska, who reigned in the second century A.D. From a consideration of intcrnal and external evidence many authorities are of opinion that Caraka Samhiid is more or less a record or compilation of the deliberations of a congress of medical experts in ancient India, held in the early Buddhistic era.

{"prompt": "Explain the following Ayurvedic text:", "completion": "opinion that Caraka Samhiid is more or less a record or compilation of the deliberations of a congress of medical experts in ancient India, held in the early Buddhistic era. Hence, the progress of scientific knowledge in ancient India, as recorded in the medical treatise of Caraka, the most celebrated of the early Indian authors on the subject, may be compared with that of contemporary Greece, as represented by the works of Hippocrates. It has, therefore, been assumed by some western scholars that the medical knowledge, as expounded by Caraka, betrays some acquaintance with the works of that Greek author, though they have failed to advance any convincing proof. iV This synoptic survey is well documented and its authors have taken good care of avoiding all attempts at improving upon Caraka’s concepts and views in order to give them an air of modernity, which often unfortunately occurs in the case of many modern publications on ancsent texts. This will help ensuring a proper assessment of the standard of scientific knowledge prevailing in India during the time of Caraka. The work will, therefore, serve as a record of reliable source materials for the compilation of a history of Indian medicine. A similar survey of the contents of Susruta Samhita is now in progress. Students of medicine and pharmacology, particularly those interested in research, -will find the publication quite useful. Moreover, it will contribute in no small measure towards the preparation of scientific terminology in Indian languages, so urgently needed at the present moment. The Convener desires to express on behalf of the retiring Board its appreciation of the meticulous care and scholarship with which Prof. P. Ray, with the assistance of Shri Hirendra Nath Gupta, has carried out the task. The monograph will be welcomed by a wide circle of interested readers. I do confidently hope that the book will not fail to achieve the purpose it has in view. D. M. Bost February 4, 1965 Convener PREFACE In the present work a synoptic survey of the Caraka Samhita, a well-known medical treatise of ancient India, has been made. The concepts, processes, methods, and materials, which occur in the treatise in a scattered manner, interspersed with an abundance of metaphysical disquisitions and with frequent reference to Vedic gods and hymns, have been co-ordinated and systematized from a scientific point of view.

{"prompt": "Explain the following Ayurvedic text:", "completion": "processes, methods, and materials, which occur in the treatise in a scattered manner, interspersed with an abundance of metaphysical disquisitions and with frequent reference to Vedic gods and hymns, have been co-ordinated and systematized from a scientific point of view. Most of the materials have been arranged in tabular forms for ready reference and rapid survey. Wherever necessary, and as far as possible, both English and Latin equivalents of all Sanskrit names and terms have been supplied to avoid ambiguitics in their identification. This is possibly the first attempt at rendering in English on a scientific basis the salient features of the views and observations of Caraka in a classified manner in order to make them accessible to all those English-speaking scholars, who may not have time and opportunities to go through the original Sanskrit text, or its English translations that are available. We would like to acknowledge here the valuable help we have received from these translations. A proper assessment of the standard of scientific knowledge, particularly of medical science, acquired by the ancient Indians at a time prior to Galen, if not even much earlier as upheld by some scholars, is thus likely to be facilitated. Students of medicine and pharmacology, interested in research work, are also expected to find this publication particularly useful for their purpose. In preparing this synopsis we have made use of the following editions of the text, and have consulted the available commentaries and translations. 1.

{"prompt": "Explain the following Ayurvedic text:", "completion": "DATE OF COMPOSITION The Caraka Samhita (literally, treatise compiled by Caraka) is a Sanskrit work of great antiquity. Though primarily a compendium on “Ayurveda” (science of life), the philosophical concepts and views that form a considerable part of the Caraka Samhita, serving, as it were, as the background of knowledge and practice of medicine in ancient India, must be considered an integral part of the work. It is difficult, if not altogether impossible, to fix an exact date for its composition, or even to identify its author with any certainty. The only text available at present is a redaction by Drdhabala of the 9th century A.D., who repeatedly mentioned in the body of the text that he merely cdited an ancient work of this name, restoring and reconstructing some missing passages. In fact, a major portion of the last book of the Samhita, ‘Siddhisthina’, was added by him The text gives a detailed account of how the Caraka Samhita was originally composed. A conference of sages, meeting somewhcre in the Himalayas, with the common object of alleviating human suffering and assuring a long, healthy and satisfying life to all, decided to take all steps to acquire the necessary knowledge for that purpose (Sa Chap. 1). Later, one of these sages, Atreya Punarvasu by name, requested six of his disciples to compile his teachings in writing (S# Chap. 2). The treatise of AgniveSa was considered the best, and the Samhita of Agnivesa, revised by Caraka at some later date, formed the basis of Drdhabala’s edition. In fact, the major portion of Caraka Samhita is presented in the form of questions and answers between the disciple Agnivesa and his teacher Atrcya. There is no reason why this account, as far as the sequence of authorship is concerned, should not be accepted as correct. Cakrapani Datta (11th century) in his commentary Ayurvedadipika on Caraka Samhita practically asserted the identity of the latter with the original Agnivesa Samhita, of which he seemed to have a full knowledge. A great deal of difficulty is however encountered, when we try to identify Atreya, Agnivega, and Caraka with authors of the same names mentioned in Brahmanical, Buddhistic, Chinese and Arabic literatures. Some of these names are found to occur as early as the Vedic period (2nd millenium B.C.) and some as late as the early centuries of the Christian era. It had been a common practice in"}
{"prompt": "Explain the following Ayurvedic text:", "completion": "with authors of the same names mentioned in Brahmanical, Buddhistic, Chinese and Arabic literatures. Some of these names are found to occur as early as the Vedic period (2nd millenium B.C.) and some as late as the early centuries of the Christian era. It had been a common practice in India, for scholars of lesser fame to assume the titles of their more renowned predecessors in their particular fields with a view to fixing a stamp of authority on their own works. This fact introduces an element of uncertainty in any tentative chronology. 2 CARAKA SAMHITA Most of the hymns of the fifth Mandala of the Rgveda are attrikuted to Atr. or to Atreya. Again, Atreya is the name of a famous medical teacher at Taxila, who, according to many Buddhistic and Chinese texts, was the preceptor of Jivaka, the personal physician of Gautama Buddha (6th century B.C.). But the Atreya of Caraka Samhita is Atreya Punarvasu, son of Candrabhaga (Si. 13, 99), whereas no Vedic text, Buddhistic source or Chinese work even mentions the title Punarvasu, or the parentage. The Caraka Samhita itself makes a mention of yet another Atreya (Si. 1,9). Nowhere does it mention Taxila as Atreya’s place of residence. On the contrary, Punarvasu Atreya is described as taking a walk in Kampilya, a city on the river Ganges (Vi. 3, 3). Though the possibility of an excursion, or of migration, cannot be ruled out, there is nothing to support his identity with the teacher of Jivaka, cxcept the surname Atreya, which is derived from the name Atri and means a descendant or follower of Atri. The identification of the author of Caraka Samhita with the teacher at Taxila, made by Rudolf Hoernle (Bower Manuscript, Introduction, p. Iviii), is not based therefore on any convincing evidence. As for Agnivcsa, the Mahabharata refers to one Agnivcga as receiving the knowledge of dhanurvidya (science of archery) from Bharadvaja (Adiparva, slokas 5107 and 5108), whereas in the Caraka Samhita Agnivesa is merely a disciple of Atreya, who in his turn received his knowledge of Ayurveda also from one Bharadvaja (Sa. Chap. 1). Here again an identification would be hazardous. The Chinese text of Tripitaka names one Tehe lo kia (i.e., Caraka in Sanskrit) as a trusted physician in the court of the king Kaniska (c. 200 A.D.) in the north-west of India.

The Chinese text of Tripitaka names one Tehe lo kia (i.e., Caraka in Sanskrit) as a trusted physician in the court of the king Kaniska (c. 200 A.D.) in the north-west of India. This Caraka has been identified by Sylvain Lévi (Notes sur les Indo-Scythes in 7.A. 1896, pp. 451-480) and by Hoernle (Studies in the Medicine of Ancient India. Part I, p. 9) with the author of the Caraka Samhita. Here again, the identification is far from convincing; for, the name and title of Caraka (literally, a wanderer) has been found in many places and contexts in ancient Indian literature and is, in fact, associated with a particular school of medical knowledge. Reference to this isfound inthe Black Yajurveda (L. Renou, Ecoles Védique, p. 129, 144, etc.). The Taittiriya Samhité, known to be a work dating from more than a thousand years before the Christian era, also speaks about the Caraka School of medicine, though not in complimentary terms (Taittiriya Samhité, V1, 4,9). It is more than possible that all subsequent Carakas, including the court-physician of Kaniska, were later exponents of this medical school, and centuries might have elapsed between any two holders of this name or title. From passages in Cakrapani Datta’s Ayurvedadipikd and in Sivaddsa Sena’s commentary on the latter work (12th century A.D.), it appears that Patafiyali, the famous grammarian (c. 2nd century B.C.) and a great alchemist, also revised Caraka Samhita. If these are to be believed, Caraka cannot by any AUTHORSHIP AND DATE OF COMPOSITION 3 stretch of imagination be placed in the court of Kaniska three or four centuries later. It is therefore extremely difficult to give any definite date when Atreya, Agnivega or Caraka of our text might have flourished. ‘ P. C. Ray (History of Hindu Chemistry, Vol. I, Introduction, pp. xiii—xxili) after considering all internal and relevant evidence places the date of composition of Caraka Samhita in the pre-Buddhistic period, i.c., before 600 B.C. His arguments are summarized below. 1. The text of Caraka is written in a haphazard and unsystematic style, intermingled with metaphysical disquisitions in sharp contrast with the precise style of works composed in the Buddhistic and later periods. 2. Vedic gods and mantras occur repeatedly, but references to Pauranic mythology and Buddhistic scriptures are conspicuous by their absence. 3. Caraka follows Vedic texts in counting the number"}

Vedic gods and mantras occur repeatedly, but references to Pauranic mythology and Buddhistic scriptures are conspicuous by their absence. 3. Caraka follows Vedic texts in counting the number of bones (360) in the human body, and in assuming the age of thirty as the limit of man’s youth. 4. The prose style of Caraka resembles that of the Brahmanas of the Vedas. 5. The treatise appears to be a record of the deliberations of Vedic ryis, often giving their discussions in full (vide discourse on tastes, Sa. Chap. 26) and clearly mentions that it was composed shortly after those deliberations. 6. Patanjali (2nd century B.C.) is known to have made a redaction of the Caraka Samhita. Jean Filliozat (La Doctrine classique de la Médicine Indienne, pp. 17-19) also believes that significant references found in the text, the stage of development of the language employed, and careful comparison with other works of established dates, can give a more reliable idea of the date of composition than the names and dates of supposed authors. He, however, considers the style and composition definitely post-Vedic and having considerable affinity with the Arthasastra of Kautilya (3rd century B.C.). According to him, the Caraka Samhita was composed in a period which antedates the Christian era, but not by a very long period. He gives the 2nd or Ist century B.G. as the most probable date. Some workers (Filliozat, loc. cit., and Gananath Sen, Pratyaksa Sdariram Vol. I, 8-11) have identified Caraka with Patafijali, but the evidence in support of this view is not very convincing. Winternitz (History of Indian Literature, part I) assigns 100 A.D. as the approximate date of Caraka Samhita, and the Chronology Committee of the National Institute of Sciences of India (Proceedings, 1952) aiter considering all available evidence adopted this date for the text, which formed the basis of Drdhabala’s redaction. 4 CARAKA SAMHITA II. SCOPE AND SUB-DIVISIONS OF THE TREATISE Caraka Samhita is primarily an exposition of Ayurveda, the science of life, defined as the science of the causes and symptoms of diseases, of their medication, and of the maintenance of health ($a. 1, 23).

{"prompt": "Explain the following Ayurvedic text:", "completion": "of life, defined as the science of the causes and symptoms of diseases, of their medication, and of the maintenance of health ($a. 1, 23). It also deals with the origin of medical science,’ the fundamental causes of conception and birth, and of physical deformities, According to Caraka, life is everlasting and without any beginning. Ayurveda, the science of life, has also been always in existence (Sd. 30, 27). _ The treatise contains a detailed classification and nomenclature of diseases—their etiology, diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. Embryology, obstetrics, anatomy, physiology, personal hygiene, sanitation, training and duties of physicians, and other theoretical and practical aspects of medicine are also treated in some detail. Interspersed in the text are passages which give valuable indications of the cosmological, biological, physicochemical, metaphysical, cthical and philosophical ideas prevalent in India at the time. According to Caraka, Ayurveda has got eight branches (Sa. 30, 30) : (1) Adyactkitsd, therapeutics. (2) Salakya, the science of the special discases of the eye, ear, nose, mouth, throat, etc. (3) Salydpahartyka, surgery. (4) Visagaravairodhikaprasamana, toxicology. (5) Bhitavidya, psychiatric knowledge. (6) Kaumdarabhytya, pediatrics. (7) Rasdyana, rejuvenation. (8) Vajikarana, knowledge for increasing virility. The Caraka Samhitéd is an cxhaustive compendium on_ therapeutic medicine and claims to contain all that is to be known in this branch ($7. 12, 53), though it contains sections devoted to the other seven branches. The scope of the treatise is stated to be limited to ten specific topics (S#. 30, 32): , i) Sarira, anatomy. (tt) Vrtti, physiology. (iit) Hetu, etiology. (1v) Vyddhe, pathology. (vit) Kala, the influence of age and seasons.) ) ) (vit) Kartr, physicians. ) ) CONCEPTS AND THEORIES 5 For a discussion of the above topics the treatise is divided into cight sections (Sa. 30, 35): (1) Stitrasthana deals with general principles, philosophy, etc. (2) Nidgnasthana deals with causes of diseases. . (3) Vimdnasthana deals with taste, nourishment, general pathology, etc. (4) Sarirasthdna deals with anatomy and embryology. (5) Indriyasthana deals with diagnosis and prognosis. (6) Cikitsdsthana deals with treatment of diseases. (7) Kalpasthana deals with pharmacy. (8) Siddhisthéna deals with cure of diseases.

There are at places some later revisions or interpolations, as repeatedly admitted by the redactor at the end of each and every chapter. In fact, Drdhabala states that he had to rewrite and complete the last section Siddhisthana from the materials available to him (Si. 12, 55). The twelfth or last chapter of this section was not available at all and had to be restored by him in order to complete the treatise (57. 12, last Sloka). III. CONCEPTS AND THEORIES (a2) Man AND MatTer: AIM OF MEDICAL SCIENCE Man, according to Caraka, is an epitome of the macrocosm (Sa. 5, 3). Following the philosophical doctrines of Samkhya and Vedanta, Caraka holds ($4. Chap. 5) that the individual is a replica of the universal; both the external world and the individual man are the manifestations of one and the same eternal spirit (Brahman). In other words, spirit and matter are not two separate entities but one integral whole. Both man and the visible world are composed of six elements. Prthvi (earth), ap (water or liquid), tejas (fire), vdyu (air) and akasa (ether) are common to both. The sixth element, the spirit or self in the individual, is equivalent to Brahman in the universe (S@. 5,4). Prthvi confers hardness, ap confers fluid constituents, éejas the body-heat, vdyu the vital breath, akaga the bodily orifices, and Brahman the spirit ($4. 5, 5). Similar to the office of the creator in the universe is the might of the individual soul in man. He also creates life by the act of impregnation ($4. 5, 6). Like the diverse things present in the universe, the different entities comprising the human being are too numerous to count ($4.5, 4). There is in man as much diversity as in the world outside (Sa. 5, 3). The human body is made up of innumerable minute parts which, because of their extreme fineness, are invisible and not amenable to sense perception. These may be compared to the cells of the body, as we now understand (S4. 7, 17). According to Caraka there are four criteria of truth: (a) authoritative | 6 CARAKA SAMHITA testimony, () direct observation, (c) logical assumption, (d) inference. Anything contrary to reason is to be rejected as untruth, (S#@ 11, 17, 26-28). To this might also be added (e) tradition and (f) analogy (Vi."}

Anything contrary to reason is to be rejected as untruth, (S#@ 11, 17, 26-28). To this might also be added (e) tradition and (f) analogy (Vi. 8, 33). The realizatign of truth or perfect knowledge by than arises from the sense of equality, i.e., from the perception of his own self as identified with everything else in the universe ($a. 5, 7), or from the perception of the unity of the whole world (Sd. 5, 8). The purpose of life is the attainment of liberation, or emancipation of the soul, which consists in the understanding and realization of truth, leading to eternal peace. This cannot be achieved merely by rituals, ceremonial practices, keeping up the sacred fire, invocations, mendicancy, austerities, asceticism, etc. ($a. 5, 10). A sound mind and a sound body were regarded as prerequisites for the beatific experience of the Divine or Brahman in man. The aim and object of the study and pursuit of medical science with this end in view was thus defined in the Caraka Samhita (Sa. 5, 10). .For, it serves as an aid to the fulfilment of fourfold purposes of life, namely, dharma (performance of duties), artha (acquisition of wealth), kdma (satisfaction of desires), and moksa (salvation or selfrealization) (Sd. 1, 15-16). Life, according to Caraka, can be divided into four types: sukhamdyuh (happy life) is a life not affected by physical or mental diseases; asukhamayuh (unhappy life) is the opposite of this; Aztamayuh (good life) is a virtuous life devoted to the service and welfare of others; ahitamdayuh (bad life) is the opposite of this. The object of the science of life is to provide information about what tends to develop all these four kinds of life and to determine their span (Sa. 30, 23-24). All matter is composed of the five mahdbhiitas (gross clements): dkdsa (vacuum or ether), vdyu (gas or air), teas (radiant encrgy), ap (liquid or water) and prthvi (solid or earth substance) (Sd. 1, 27). The gross bhiitas show five subtile characteristics : non-resistance, motion, heat, fluidity and hardness. Akdga has the sole quality of non-resistance. In each succeeding element there is found the preceding element or elements with their characteristic properties, as well as its own specific quality (Sa. 1, 27-29). Living things"}
{"prompt": "Explain the following Ayurvedic text:", "completion": "27). The gross bhiitas show five subtile characteristics : non-resistance, motion, heat, fluidity and hardness. Akdga has the sole quality of non-resistance. In each succeeding element there is found the preceding element or elements with their characteristic properties, as well as its own specific quality (Sa. 1, 27-29). Living things are composed of the mahabhitas and three other constituents: avyakta (dtman or unmanifest self), buddht (intelligence) and ahamkdara (ego). Thus they have the eight-fold prakyti (natural characteristics) ($a. 1,63). The ego is made up of action, the consequences of action, reincarnation and memory, and is independent of the physical body. It can exist without the latter (Sa. 1, 52). The five mahabhiitas, together with the spirit, mind, time and space, constitute the totality of all substances (Sa. 1,48). They are perceptible to the senses or to the mind ($@. 1, 62). But they cannot exist singly or without purpose; being ephemeral by nature they cannot escape destruction ($4. 1, 58). CONCEPTS AND THEORIES 7 Of the substances, those which possess sense-organs are called animate, and those which do not are called inanimate. The gunas represent the sense properties of colour, taste, smell, touch, and hearing, besides the mechanical and other properties *which all elemgnts have in common (Sa. 1, 48-50). All senses are mere variations of the five mahabhiitas, but each sense partakes of one mahdbhita in a preponderating degree and possesses a special capacity for grasping that particular mahdbhiita (Sd. 8, 14). Conscious perception arises from the fusion of the dtman, mind, senses and sense-objects ($d. 1, 34). This fusion cannot be achieved by accident; an agent is necessary ($d. 1, 44). The ultimate source of consciousness and knowledge is the Purusa or transcendent self ($d. 1, 41). The Purusa has no beginning in time; it is not manifest to the senses, cannot be realized except by inference and docs not come under any known category (Sd. 1, 60 and 62). It is everlasting, all-pervading and changeless (Sa. 1, 61). Had there been no Purusa there would have been neither good nor evil, no knowledge, no doer and no knower ($4. 1, 39). All these would be causcless. Neither could there be any awareness of these, nor would they serve any purpose by their existence ($a. 1, 42).

There would have been no dissolution nor creation, no birth nor death, no continuity of life, no consciousness nor perception, no pleasure nor pain, no dynamic nor static condition, no science nor scripture, no bondage nor liberation, if there were no Purusa (Sa. 1, 38-41). Caraka holds that life results from the combination of the body, the scnses, the mind and the self (aiman), and that it rests on the body, the mind and the self, as on a tripod. If, therefore, any of these supports be missing, life ceases to exist (S# 1, 42, 46). As already statcd, transcendent self (parah dtma) 1s different from manifest sclf which participates in the union of the body, mind and the senses (Si. 1, 41, 45, 47, 55, 56). (b) CONCEPTION AND BirtTH There are four different origins of living beings: womb, egg, sweat, and the seed. Each of these classcs shows countless varieties. The viviparous and oviparous embryos assume the shape of such wombs as they find themselves in, though they originate from a complex of causative factors ($4. 3, 16). Conception occurs inside the womb by the union of semen, ovum and the spirit ($a.4,5). By the physical act of mating union takes place between the semen (sperm cell) and the female ovum (germ cell); then the spirit, associated with the mind, descends and enters into the zygote formed, and a new embryonic life is created (Sd. 3, 2). If the spirit does not descend, no life is created and conception fails to occur ($4. 3, 11), The conscious spirit eravitates to the needed ingredients; it creates its own body by gathering the elements together—first the dkdsa (ether) alone, then in due order the other bhittas, The process is completed in an infinitely small fraction of time (S@. 4, 8). 8 CARAKA SAMHITA The conception of all living beings originates from the combined contribution of the mother, the father, the spirit, the essence of the elemental properties and nourishment (Sd. 3, 3). It is the mind which yokes the living organism to the spirit and holds the senses together. With the departure of the mind, the organism becomes a lifeless matter ($4. 3, 13).

It is the mind which yokes the living organism to the spirit and holds the senses together. With the departure of the mind, the organism becomes a lifeless matter ($4. 3, 13). The spirit in the embryo is the embodied soul. The soul is eternal, diseaseless, decayless, ageless, deathless, indivisible, indestructible, immovable, omniform, omnifunctional, immutable, invisible and infinite ($d, 3, 8). Hence, there is no birth in the true sense. What we call birth is the mere transition of the already existing sperm, ovum and spirit to the new status of embryo after their union ($4. 3, 8), The spirit is the eternal self and passes through a succession of forms, having no beginning. Life and the spirit, both are without beginning and ncither is antecedent to the other (Sd. 1, 82). (c) Herepiry anp Emspryonic GROWTH Caraka assumes that the sperm-cell (dija) of the male parent contains minute elements derived from each of his organs and tissues (Sd. 4,7). A rational explanation is attempted of the fact that offsprings do not necessarily reproduce every feature of the father, and even a particular womb does not produce identical features in every embryo conceived in it. A human womb invariably produces a human child in the manner of a wax-mould ($4. 3, 16), but children differ in many important respects from their parents ($a. 3, 17). They may be males or females, twins, multiplets (Sa. 2, 11), possessed of sexual abnormalities (Sa. 2, 31) and may have individual characteristics and deformities ($4. 2, 28-29). When the sperm (sukra) is dominant, a male foetus is formed, but a female is produced when the female germ (sonita) predominates ($a. 2, 12). If the united sperm-ovum gets divided into two or more fragments, a corresponding number of new lives are created (Sd. 2,14). In this case a male is formed from a fragment rich in sperm and female from one rich in ovum ($4. 2, 13), Non-identical twins or multiplets result from unequal fragments (Sd. 2, 16). Indeterminate sex and abnormalities occur when neither the sperm nor the ovum predominates, or when they are diseased and weak ($4. 2, 18-21). Caraka also attempts to explain why congenital deformities of the parents, or constitutional diseases contracted by them in later life, are not necessarily inherited.

Caraka also attempts to explain why congenital deformities of the parents, or constitutional diseases contracted by them in later life, are not necessarily inherited. According to Atreya’s view given in the text (§d. 3, 15), the parental dija (seed or germ-plasm) contains the whole parental organism in a potential or miniature form but is independent of the parents’ developed organs, and is not necessarily affected by their idiosyncrasies or deformities. It is the combination and characters of the constituent elements of the parental bya, which is an organic entity independent of the developed parental body and its organs, that determine the physiological features and predispositions CONCEPTS AND THEORIES 9 of the embryo. Congenital defects like blindness, deafness, dumbness, stammering, lameness, deformity of the spinal column or the bony framework, as well as constitutional diseases like madness, leprosy or chronic skin diseascs in the parent, do not nectssarily produce corresponding deformities or infirmities in the offspring. Only when an element in the parental bija, representing a particular organ or tissue accidentally (daiva) happens to be defective, undeveloped, or abnormal, the corresponding organ or tissue of the offspring will be similarly affected. Again when constitutional diseases, acquired in later life, are found to be inherited, it is supposed that the bija has been infected or affected in that particular instance. Leprosy, for cxample, is transmitted to the offspring only when the germ-plasm is actually infected with the disease by reason of the leprosy of the parent ($4. 3, 15). This mutual interaction of the germ-plasm and the somatic tissues seems to be a distinctive feature of Atreya’s hypothesis. The continued identity of the germ-plasm from generation to generation, affected by somatic processes only by accident or infection, follows logically from this hypothesis. Hence offsprings differ from their parents in those tissues and organs whose original representatives in the germ-plasm have been affected by causative factors. The sex, stature and complexion of the offspring is also stated to be affected by the influence of abundant or defective nutrition and by the constituents of foods taken by the parents (Sd. 3, 5). The elements that contribute to the general features of the new-born child are: (1) the mother’s blood, (2) the father’s semen, and (3) the karma of the individual.

The elements that contribute to the general features of the new-born child are: (1) the mother’s blood, (2) the father’s semen, and (3) the karma of the individual. Its mental traits are determined by the state of the mind of the individual in its previous birth, and will be impure and dull if it was an animal in the previous birth (Sa. 2, 27). The embryo inherits its skin, blood, flesh, fat, heart, liver, lungs, spleen, kidneys, stomach, intestines, etc. from its mother (4. 3, 6); its bones, tceth, veins, tendons, ligaments, arteries, semen, hair and nails from its father (Sd. 3, 7); its mind, senses, consciousness, ego, memory and life-span from the spirit ($d. 3, 10); its clarity of senses, quality of voice, appetite and vitality from parental concordance (Sa. 3, 11); its visible shape, vigour, sense of contentment and energy from nourishment (a. 3, 12). The embryo is a shapeless jelly (khetabhita) in the first month (Sa. 4, 9) and a tumour-like or fleshy shape in the second. By this time there is the first indication of the future sex of the embryo ($a. 4, 10). In the third month the limbs and sense-organs are no longer latent but emerge as separate entities ($a. 4, 11). In the fourth month, the foetus is stabilized and the mother puts on weight (Sd. 4, 20). It grows in flesh and blood in the fifth month and in strength and colour in the sixth, at the expense of the mother who becomes emaciated, weak and pale (Sa. 4, 21-22). In the seventh month there is an all-round development and in the eighth there is a continuous flow of 10 CARAKA SAMHITA vitality to and from the mother ($4. 4, 23-24). It continues to grow by nourishment until delivery, which should occur in the ninth or tenth month ($4. 4,25). Any factor which upsets the proper sequence leads to an abnormal period of gestation, or destruction of the foetus (Sa. 459). The first stage of foetal development has been assumed differently by different experts in the discourse given in the Caraka Samhita (Sd. 6, 21).

The child in the womb has its limbs folded, its head erect and its back towards the mother’s abdomen (Sa. 6, 22). Its heart is connected with the mother’s heart through the umbilical cord and the placenta; the latter is flooded with blood by the pulsating arteries of the mother. The mother’s blood transmits nourishment, vitality, and complexion. The skin-pores of the foetus also absorb the nourishment ($4. 6, 23). The two minds (of the mother and the foetus) have an intimate psychical connection (Sa. 4, 15/2). The foetus may be destroyed, deformed or may suffer psychic injuries due to physical and emotional disturbance of the mother (Sa. 4, 15-30). Faulty diet and habits, as well as mental shocks, a comprehensive list of which is given in the text, also contribute to this end ($a. 8, 21). Instructions are also given by Caraka for the proper care of the pregnant woman; these include specified dict, prophylactic treatment and maintenance of emotional harmony ($d. 8, 32/1). Such treatments ensure good health, vitality and a pliable womb for the mother, and a soft placenta at the time of delivery (Sd. 8, 32). The text describes in some detail the symptoms of recent and advanced pregnancy (Sd. 2, 22; 4, 15), and the pre-indications of male and female births (Sa. 2, 24-25). Methods of ensuring the birth of male offspring ($4. 8, 11-19) are also indicated. The signs of imminent delivery ($4. 8, 36), the requirements of an wellappointed maternity house ($4. 8, 33-35), methods of minimizing labour pains (Sa. 8, 38-39), proper handling and help in delivery ($4. 8, 40-41), and postnatal care of the child (Sd. 8, 42-45) and its mother (S@. 8, 48-49) are also described in detail. (dq) Humorat THrory (Concept or THE Oricin or Diszaszs) The well-known humoral theory, which postulates the existence of three humors in the human body—named vdyu (or vdta), pitta and kapha, is built upon the premise that apart from a few exceptions all human beings have a predominance of one of the three humors from the very moment of conception (Sd. 7, 39).

The few exceptions are equipoised, enjoying perfect health; the rest can be classified according to the continual predominance of a particular humor in their system. The inherent imbalance makes them always susceptible to diseases (Si 7, 40). The types can be diagnosed by their physical characteristics (Vi. 8, 96-99). But diseases actually occur when CONCEPTS AND THEORIES 1] the humors are provoked (Vi. 6, 13). In normal health the three humors are balanced (Vi. 6, 13/2). But if a person of the vdia type indulges in foods and acts which provoke that humor, the vdta is aggravated and afflicts the person’s body with physical and mental disorders of the vata type and impairs his strength, health, complexion and span of life (Vi. 6, 16/1). The same consequences are in store for the person of the pztta type when that humor is provoked, and same also holds good for the third humor, kapha (Vi. 6, 18/1). The individual types are much less affected and may in fact be benefited by indulging in foods and acts which provoke the other two humors (V2. 6, 13 -18; Sa. Chapter 20). All pathological conditions of the mind and the body, and even their degrees of severity, are direct results of morbid and aggravated humors (Vi. 6, 4-9). The morbidity of one humor can be accompanied by that of a second or by both the others, giving rise to a simultaneous discordance of two or three humors (Vz. 6, 11). Thus permutations and combinations of threc humors in different degrees may give rise to numerous pathological symptoms (Vz. chapter 6). According to the severity of the provoked humors, all diseases can be classified as incurable, major, or minor (Vi. chapter 7). It is the physician’s duty to try to correct as far as it lies in his power the specific imbalances and to relieve the aggravated humors by proper dict and treatment for each class and type of diseases. Some portions of the Satrasthana (Chap. 12, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 24, 27), practically the entire Ctkitsdsthana and Nidanasthana, and portions of the other sthdnas are devoted to the descriptions of various diseases, their classifications according to humors, as well as their dietetic and medicinal treatments.

The three humors vdyu, pitta and kapha, when abnormal (prakupita), and the various waste products of the body tend to weaken or destroy the body. These are called malas. So long as they remain in proper measure they do not pollute or weaken the body or give rise to diseases. Within their proper measure even the malas are called dhdtus (body-constituents). Mala dhatus and prasdda dhatus (body-constituents which specifically help sustenance and growth) thus co-operate in maintaining the body (Si. 28, 3). The places in the body, which are usually affected by vdta, pitta and kapha in their abnormal (prakupita) condition, as described by Caraka, are: bladder, rectum, waist, bones of the legs, and specially the smaller intestine (pakvasaya) for vata affection; sweat, blood, particularly the stomach, for pitta affection; head, neck, the joints, stomach, fat and particularly the chest for kapha affection (Si. 20, 8). The physician should find out not only which dosa (humor) is abnormal, but also which qualities of that dosa have run to excess. The nature of the disturbance of a dosa (humor) is determined by the nature of the disturbance of its qualities involved (N12. 1, 13). 12 CARAKA SAMHITA (e) Vayu AND ITs Rove 1n HuMAN SysTEM AND IN Nature (Sd. 12,8) According to Caraka vdyu is that which keeps the machine of the body at work. Itis the impelling force for all bodily efforts, and sets in motion the sense organs and the mind; it regulates the body elements, maintains equilibrium in the body, stimulates digestion, eliminates harmful matter and waste products, and gives shape to the foetus. It manifests itself in five forms: prana, uddna, samdana, vyana, and apana. Their seats in different parts of the body and their physiological effects are also specified (Ci. 28, 4-9). When activated in an abnormal state vdyu may create diseases of the body, cause mental depression, affect the sense organs, destroy or deform the foetus, or increase the period of gestation.

In nature vdyu serves as an envelope for the earth, supports combustion, causes the formation of clouds, the condensation and precipitation of water as rain, and gives rise to streams. It helps growth of plants, flowers, fruits and crops, and maintains the division of seasons. Vayu in an abnormal state in nature is identified with storms and winds, causing damage to matter and life. The properties of vdyu has been described by Caraka as dry (suksa), cold (Sita), light (/aghu), subtle (siiksma), moving (cala), scattering everything in different directions (visada) and rough (khara), Vayu has been identified with the continuity of life (Sd. 1, 59; 12, 8). (f) MemMory anpD DREAM Caraka has enumerated eight causes of memory ($4. 1, 148-149): (a) Impressions, similar and dissimilar; (b) co-ordination of mind; (c) practice; (d) knowledge; (e) recollection; (f, g, & A) repetition of sight, hearing, and perception Dreams have been classified by Caraka into seven types, based on (In. 5, 27-46): (a2) Visual impression; (b) auditory impression; (c) experience; (d) inner desires; (¢) fancy; (f) premonition; (g) morbid humors. An account of the different varieties of dreams arising from morbid humors has been given, particularly those foreboding death. (g) Ermics In CARAKA Caraka advances a very catholic and commonsense view of karma and rebirth differing from those of other Indian philosophers. The laws of karma are not considered immutable by Caraka who allows a limited amount of freedom to human efforts in arresting the fruits of all ordinary non-moral actions. Only the effects of very good or bad moral actions cannot be thus modified or averted by human efforts. The fruits of all non-moral or ordinary actions can be averted by the exercise of human intelligence, PHYSIOLOGICAL PROCESSES “43 wisdom and well-balanced conduct, and by the administration of proper medicine and the like. Caraka therefore holds that right conduct (sadvrtia) can help in the preservation of physical and mental health and in securing sensecontrol (indnyavyaya) (Vi. 3, 28-38; Sz. 8, 17). Caraka recognizes that there are three primary desires serving as the springs or causes of all our actions. These are: desire for self-preservation (pranaisand), desire for wealth (dhanaisand), and a desire for a happy future life (paralokatsana) (Sa. 11, 3, 7, 8, 13). IV.

These are: desire for self-preservation (pranaisand), desire for wealth (dhanaisand), and a desire for a happy future life (paralokatsana) (Sa. 11, 3, 7, 8, 13). IV. PHYSIOLOGICAL PROCESSES (a) DIGESTION AND METABOLISM Production of heat in the body is said to be the basis of life process. The life-span, vital breath, vital essence, body-heat, muscular strength, energy, lustre, etc., all are dependent upon the production of heat inside the organism. When the body-heat becomes abnormal, discase results; when it is suppressed or dies out, there is an end of life (Ci. 15, 3-4). In the Caraka Samhita the word agnt has been used for body-heat; its literal meaning is fire. This is related closely to metabolic processes (V2. 6, 12). This production of body-heat depends upon the intake of food. Food nourishes the body clements, vital essence, strength, etc.; but the nutrient action of food is a result of gastric digestion. If the process of digestion is hampered, food fails to nourish (C1. 15, 5). Ingested food and drink pass into the stomach and are broken up and softened by the digestive fluid in the stomach, During this process, the food is transformed into a swect, frothy mucus-like fluid. As the digestive process continues, it becomes acidic and, issuing out of the stomach, excites the secretion of thin bile (C7. 15, 8-10). Ultimately it is converted into assimilable nutritive fluid and also some waste products. Excrctions of the body are formed from the waste products (Sa. 28, 4/7). The process of digestion ends in the large intestines wherc the remnants are converted into lumps of stool (C7. 15, 11). , The nutritive fluid formed is converted into blood, flesh, fat, bone-marrow, semen, ligaments and clear fluid (serum ?), as well as the sensory faculties (Si. 28, 4/2). The body elements are replenished by the food and are able to maintain the body in a proper condition by gathering the necessary ingredients from food. This replenishment and maintenance take place when the various metabolic processes are proceeding without interruption, and the srotémst (movements of body-fluids) are unimpeded in their proper channels. The nutritive fluid then pervades the whole body (Si. 28, 3). The body channels, constituting the means of passage of the nutritive fluids from food, feed the various body elements in the requisite measure 14"}

The body channels, constituting the means of passage of the nutritive fluids from food, feed the various body elements in the requisite measure 14 CARAKA SAMHITA and with the required constituents (Sa. 28, 5/1). The requirements of the body according to size, condition and age determine the quantity of nutritive fluid formed from food, thus maintaining the balance of the body elements (Sa. 28, 4/3 and 4/4). ’ . From the waste products of digestion are formed: sweat, urine and stools; the morbid forms of the three body-humors; the excretions of the eyes, cars, nose, mouth, hair-follicles and female parts; the hairs of the head, face and body; and the nails, The quantities produced depend on the age, size and condition of the body (Sa. 28, 4/1 and 4/4). (6) MovEMENT OF FLUIDS THROUGH CHANNELS OF THE Human Bopy Caraka states that there are innumerable srotdms: or fluid currents through numcrous channels in the human body. They serve to convey nutrients and healing matters where needed, and to carry away decaying and harmful products formed. These srotas convey the products of the body elements— blood, flesh, fat, bone, marrow, nutritional juices, semen and _life-breath. These body elements cannot develop or decay independently of the srotas (Vi. 5, 4). . There is as much functional diversity of these channel systems as in the structural composition of the rest of the human body, but the most important among them are those which carry life-breath, water, food, nutritive juices, blood, flesh, fat, bone-matter, marrow, semen, urinc, stool and sweat. The three humors—vdta, pitta and kapha—diffluse throughout the entire body with the help of all these channel systems. The supersensory essences of man are independent of the channels; the entire sentient body is, in fact, both the vehicle and the field of their operation (Vi. 5, 3 and 6). The channels are normally in the form of elongated vessels, extensive ducts or convoluted tubes. In dimension, they vary from large to very fine ones (Vi. 5, 25). The various types found in the body are: (a) sird or vein, (b) dhamani or artery, (c) rasdyanya or ducts, (d) nddi or tube, (e) panthd or tract, (f) marga or passage, (g) Sariracchidra or body-orifice, (h) samurtdsamorta (vessel open at"}

Some of the channel systems are not visible to the naked eye (Vi. 5, 9). The srotémsi have specified centres and areas of operation. Such areas develop characteristic symptoms, if any of the srofas systems is vitiated or obstructed. (Vi. 5, 6). This obstruction is not limited to the stationary and mobile body-channels of the specified area, but may spread to the other srotas systems. If, however, any one of the three humors is affected, the entire body is also affected (Vi. 5, 9). In the heart are rooted the ten main channels that carry the vital essence through the whole length and breadth of the body. These main channels PHYSIOLOGICAL PROCESSES 15 are either dhamanis which pulsate, or srotémst which carry nutritive fluids, or stré (Sd. 30, 8 and 12), Heart is regarded as the only seat of consciousness (Sa. 7, 8-9), while prdna (the vital current) and all the senses emanate from the head (Si. 9,4). , ° ° ; The heart is the source of the life-breath srotas; the bronchial area is the source of the water srotas; the region of the stomach, particularly the left side, is the source of the food srotas; the heart with its ten main channels is the source of the srotas of nutrition; the liver and spleen are the source of the blood srotas; the muscles and skin are the source of the flesh srotas; the kidneys and the omentum are the source of the fat srotas; the body fat is the source of the bonematter srofas; the bones and joints, of the marrow srotas; the testes and phallus, of the semen srotas; the kidneys and the bladder, of the urine srotas; the colon and the rectum, of the stool srofas; and the fat and hair-follicles, of the sweat srotas (Vi. 5, 8).

When the srotamsi are in an abnormal state, there is an increased or decreased flow of the fluids they carry; the channels also become knotted and there is diversion of flow to abnormal channels. The treatment of such conditions consists of treating the various parts of the body which have been recognized as the specific centres of the various srotamsi (Vi. 5, 24, 26-28). (c) Tastes The taste is an intrinsic property of material substances. There are only six basic tastes—sweet, acid, saline, pungent, bitter and astringent ($@. 26,9). These six categories of taste, according to Caraka, emerge in different substances from the collocation in uncqual proportions (preponderance or paucity) of the five mahabhitas or primal elements. The same view is held regarding the origin of colour (Sa. 26, 40/2). The sensation, which is immediately perceived on contact of the substance proper with the tonguc, is called ‘taste’. Any sensation subsequent thereto is called the after-taste or latent taste. The physiological action of all substances depends upon the taste and also its after-taste, if any (Sa. 26, 28, 43). All tastes are conveyed through the medium of water which, according to Caraka, sustains all animal and plant life (Sd. 26, 30). But water has a taste which is imperceptible. Palatability, or otherwise, of a substance 1s a matter of personal idiosyncracy, while its beneficial or harmful action depends on factors, like its composition, purity and the time and clime of its use ($d. 26, 9). Single or pure tastes are to be found in many substances, but they occur mostly in combinations, For example, alkaline substances possess a complex taste, with saline and pungent tastes predominating. By the presence of two, three, four, five or all six tastes in the same substance, fifty-seven mixed tastes may arise, which with the six simple tastes make sixty-three different tastes (Sd. 26, 9 and 24). 16 CARAKA SAMHITA In common with the bodily humors, tastes have the inherent propertie: of heaviness, lightness, coldness, heat, oiliness and dryness.

Thus, with th taste as guide, all edible and medicinal substances, taken in the right measur and manner, are invariably beneficial (Si. 26, 43-44). V.

The use of collyrium at night and of eye-salve and eye-dror after exposure to glare are recommended for good eyesight. Smoking ¢ pipes and cigars, containing medicinal herbs, at regular intervals everyday said to prevent neuralgic pains and increase mental alertness (Sa 5, 15-27 but many complications and even permanent injury may be caused by uncor trolled smoking, especially in an exhausted or intoxicated state (S#. 5, 38 45). The application of medicated oil to the nostrils at prescribed times retarc senility and maintains the acuteness of sight, smell and hearing (Sia. 5, 48-70 Brushing the teeth twice a day with partly crushed green twigs of certai plants, and scraping the tongue with shaped metallic scrapers, ensure stron tecth, sweet breath and a good appetite. Medicated gargles keep the faci: muscles young, sharpen taste, increase appetite, and prevent dental deca (Sa 5, 71-80). Daily massage of the scalp and hair with approved vegetable oils preven insomnia, baldness, grey hairs and sagging of the face muscles (S#. 5, 81-83 Draining the ear-passage with oil prevents deafness and other affections | the ear (Sd. 5, 84). Daily massage of the body prevents excessive sweating, removes offensi body-odour and gives suppleness to muscles and tendons (Sa 5, 90-93 Massaging with oils acts as a tonic to the skin, induces tolerance to physic hardship, makes the contours of the body firm and the skin glossy (Sa. 5, 8 86).

HEALTH AND LONGEVITY 17 Bathing promotes vitality, physical stamina, longevity and removes fatigue (Si. 5, 94). The feet and private parts are to be kept scrupulously clean, and the hair, beard and nails regularly trimmed (Si. 5, 98). The use of clean apparel, foot-wear and umbrellas promotes mental as well as physical comfort, and ensures good health (Sa. 5, 95, 100-101). Regulated physical exercise aids digestion and increases capacity for work and physical strength, but overexercise or excessive physical work, indicated by an increased rate of respiration and a feeling of oppression in the cardiac region, causes debility and wasting diseases (Si. 7, 31-35). In order to maintain good health one should not unnecessarily or unduly suppress the natural urges and body-functions; he should not sleep in a crooked position, nor on a narrow and uneven bed; he should not ride on an uncomfortable saddle or carriage-seat; he should not gaze directly at the sun or strong lights, nor expose himself to strong sunlight, storm or snow-fall for extended periods, nor warm himself directly before or over a fire; he should not indulge excessively in alcoholic drinks, heavy meals, or sexual acts, nor mate with a diseased or unfit partner, nor take part in unnatural or improper sexual relations; he should avoid keeping late hours, taking a cold bath or a cold drink in a fatigued condition, and using soiled clothes after a bath (Si. 8, 19-22). The mental impulses of greed, fear, anger, excessive melancholy, vanity, hatred, harsh speech and evil thoughts are as injurious to the body as to the mind (Si, 7, 26-28). All harmful physical and mental habits can be overcome gradually by proper training or by personal effort (Sa. 7, 36-38). Special measures are recommended for the maintenance of health during scasonal changes. Sudation, sunbath, warm apartments, thick and protective dress and bedding, and rich food are recommended when the cold season sets in ($d, 6, 9-21). Physical exercise, lightly cooked meats and light alcoholic beverages are prescribed for spring time (S$#, 6, 24-26). Rich food, alcohol and hard exercise should be avoided in summer.

Physical exercise, lightly cooked meats and light alcoholic beverages are prescribed for spring time (S$#, 6, 24-26). Rich food, alcohol and hard exercise should be avoided in summer. In the hottest days one should not venture out in the noon-time heat, but take rest by sleeping during the day in order to compensate for keeping late hours at night (Si. 7, 30). Thrice a year at prescribed seasons, the body should be cleansed of all accumulated waste matter by sudation, steam-baths, emesis, purgative drugs, enemas, and douches (Si. 7, 47). (6) Errects of ENVIRONMENT ON HEALTH Caraka treats bodily health not only as a personal problem, but also in its relation to heredity (Sa. 3, 3-17), geographical environment, climate, water-supply and seasonal variations (Vi. 3,6). The possibility of diseases due to such external factors alone was recognized (Vi. 3, 4). 18 CARAKA SAMHITA According to Caraka, though individual persons differ widely in physical health and vitality, they are collectively liable to devastating epidemics caused by external factors (Vi. 3, 6-7). Inhabitants of open spaces with scanty rainfall,‘and predominance of dry winds and of isolated forest areas are generally well-knit, hardy and healthy. Inhabitants of humid climates with abundant rainfall, marshy lands, deltas, and dense forests are generally delicate in physique and in health. Areas with a proper balance of dry and moist seasons and of open spaces and forests generally contribute to good health (Ka. 1, 8; Vi. 3, 7, 47). It is stated that from the beginning of the summer to the end of the rainy season there is a gradual waning of strength in man (Sd. 6, 6-7). The cold season increases appetite and digestive power, when, with proper nourishment, the bodily vigour reaches its highest peak (Si. 6, 8-9). (c) Nutrition AND Drier Ahdratattva (Si. 25, 35, ctc.) or dietetics forms an important and integral part of the Caraka Samhitd (Si. Chap. 5, 6, 25, 26, 27; Sa. Chap. 6). Wholesome diet 1s stated to promote bodily growth and health; unwholesome food is the most important cause of diseases (Sd. 25, 31). The importance of a proper diet in health and sickness is repeatedly stressed upon ($a. Chap. 5, 6; Sd.

The importance of a proper diet in health and sickness is repeatedly stressed upon ($a. Chap. 5, 6; Sd. Chap. 6), In the chapter on digestion it is asserted that the life-process itself depends upon the production of: body-heat, derived from the food taken (Ci. 15, 3-5). A direct relationship is said to exist between the tastes of substances and their physiological actions. No distinction can be drawn between foods and drugs, as both possess taste and nutritive value, and exert specific action on the body. Edible and potable substances are classified into cereals, legumes, potable water, salts, pot-herbs, fish, flesh, fruits, sugarcane derivatives, milk, ghee and other milk products, vegetable oils, lards, animal fats, and alcoholic beverages (Sa. 25, 38). The most nutritive and the most harmful in each class are listed (Si. 25, 38-39). Eggs, blood and semen of various creatures are also stated to have nutritive value, though their use is not recommended (Sa. 6, 10). The text mentions in detail the digestibility, nutritive value and medicinal action of several hundred different edible and potable substances of various classes (Sz. Chap. 27), It is pointed out that all such substances can gain in nutritive value or become harmful by combination with other items, by cooking or preparation, and according to quantity taken, palatability, appetite, bodily health, local climate, season, and eating habits (Sa. 26, 87-89). A list of substances which are incompatible with each other, or unwholesome in particular seasons, is given (Si. 26, 84 et seq.). HEALTH AND LONGEVITY 19 Even light, easily digested and nutritious food should not be taken in excess of bodily requirements, or after the appetite has been satisfied. Difficultly digestible food should not be taken habitually. If ever used, the quantity should not excéed a fraction pf a full meal (Sa 5, 7-11). Rich spicy foods, fats, and alcoholic drinks are stated to be beneficial in the cold season; lightly cooked cereals and meats, salts and light wines in spring and autumn; and light gruels, vegetables, fruits and acidulated cold drinks in summer (Sd. Chap. 6). According to their intrinsic properties different foods undergo metabolism into body-elements of the same nature and inhibit the formation of those having opposite properties (Sa. 6, 16).

A properly planned diet, using various aggreeable and nourishing foods in rotation, regulates the bodyclements (Sa. 6, 6 and 7). (dq) REJUVENATION Revitalization thcrapy is a prominent feature of the Caraka Samhita. It is suggested that the body-fluids are capable of being replenished and renewed by proper medication; and that it is possible to achieve not only vitality and vigour, but also greater resistance to diseasc, longevity without senile decay, heightened memory and intelligence, and an improvement in bodily strength, personal beauty and sense perceptions. In fact, Caraka asserts that even in old age it is possible to regain youth and remain youthful for a very long period. (Ci. 1/1, 6-12). The treatment for rejuvenation follows the fulfilment of three preliminary conditions: namely, the patient must start with a single-minded determination and complete faith; he should undergo the treatment in a nursing home (the exact specifications and equipment of which are listed); he should remain under the constant supervision of his physician. The season and weather for treatment must be properly selected (Cz. 1/1, 17-23). The body is then thoroughly cleansed by oil massage and sudation by various means. A course of intestinal aperients like myrobolans, rock-salt and special spices is given for cleansing the intestines. The diet is limited to light gruel and warm water (C7, 1/1, 25-27). Many preparations are prescribed for the actual rejuvenation process. The fruits, plants and herbs used for such prescriptions must be collected from Himalayan forests in their proper seasons and in perfect and flawless state. Pure honey, ghee, salts and minerals are also mentioned as ingredients in many prescriptions. Special diets are described in all cases (Ci. Chap. 1). Claims have been made that it is possible by a special course of rejuvenation to transform entirely an aged and diseased body into a fresh and youthful one in the course of six months (C7. 1/4, 7). 20 CARAKA SAMHITA (ec) Pusiic SANITATION Some advice regarding public sanitation is found in the Caraka Samhita.

People are urged to avoid all filthy matters like offal, broken fragments of cooking vessels, and waters of public baths (S#. 8, 18/6). . Blowing the nose in a crowd or committing nuisance on a public road is forbidden. Adultery, association with prostitutes, gambling, drunkenness, crude habits of eating, dirty or inadequate dress, and picking the nose, or sneezing, are considered unhealthy practices to be avoided by those aspiring after a clean and meritorious life ($a. 8, 19-25). Contaminated water is recognized to be a major cause of ill health and epidemics (Vi, 3, 7), and the use of only clean and pure water from natural sources is recommended at various places of the text (Si. 6, 47, etc.). VI. PHYSICIANS IN CARAKA The Caraka Samhita lays down an elaborate code regarding the training, duties, privileges and social status of physicians. Any person could aspire to be a physician, provided he had a clear idea of the duties and obligations pertaining to the profession. Good health, capacity for sustained effort and single-minded devotion to the science were considered as essential qualifications for the student of medicine. An austere and celibate life was enjoined for the disciple during his training period (V1. 8, 3, 7, 13). The student was free to choose his own branch of the science. The choice of a teacher also rested with him. But it was for the teacher to assess the merit of the candidate from his appearance, voice, acuteness of sensory perceptions, personality, intellectual capacity and mental outlook before selecting him as a disciple. Instructions were given free. The disciple lived with the preceptor like a son, slave or supplicant till the training was completed and had to follow a rigid time-table (Vz. 8, 3, 4, 7, 8, 13). Aspiration for success, wealth and fame was considered normal on the part of an intending physician; but obligations to his future patients and to the society were repeatedly impressed upon by the preceptor. Desertion of, or injury to, patients under any circumstances was strictly forbidden (V2. 8, 13). A physician should remain, in a sense, a student all his life, gaining experience, knowledge and understanding. Great stress has been laid on periodic discussions and debates with other physicians in conferences and in private (Vi. 8, 13, 20). Theoretical knowledge, clarity of"}

A physician should remain, in a sense, a student all his life, gaining experience, knowledge and understanding. Great stress has been laid on periodic discussions and debates with other physicians in conferences and in private (Vi. 8, 13, 20). Theoretical knowledge, clarity of reasoning, wide practical experience, and personal skill have been described as the four valued qualifications of the physician (Vi, 9,6). He is expected to lead a disciplined and unostentatious life, to be pleasant in his manners, and to be considerate and DIAGNOSIS OF DISEASES 21 gentle in speech (Vz. 8, 13). Friendship towards all, compassion for the ailing, devotion to professional duties and a philosophical attitude to cases with fatal endings—these have been defined as the four corner-stones of medical practice (Si. 9, 26). Caraka advises that the physicians, while treating diseases, should also observe the instructions of the Atharvaveda, which include svastyayana (propitiatory rites), balt (offerings), matigala homa (auspicious oblations), niyama (penances), prayascitta (purificatory rites), upavdsa (fasting) and mantra (incantations), as also the use of mant (gems) in amulets (Sd. 30, 21; 26, 70; Ci. 1, 3.) According to Caraka a physician is not expected to treat a person hated by the king or by the public (V7. 8, 13), or a habitually vicious or dishonourable person (Vi, 3, 45). He is also not expected to treat patients suffering from incurable maladies (Sa. 10, 8). The physician must not enter a private house without previous permission or proper introduction, nor attend a woman in the absence of her husband or guardian. He must not also say or do anything which might shock the patient or the relations and friends of the patient. He must not divulge any information about the patient and his household (Vz. 8, 13). The physician, according to CGaraka, should be held in high respect both by the king and the public ($a. 9, 19). The practice of medicine by unqualified persons or self-styled physicians has been strongly condemned (S@. 29, 12). The physician is expected to maintain his own nursing home and dispensary, prepare medicinal preparations from raw materials, and arrange for the services of nurses and qualified attendants (Sz. Chap. 15). VII. DIAGNOSIS OF DISEASES The Samhita gives directions for the diagnosis of a large number of diseases from a consideration of their etiology, symptoms and prognosis.

DIAGNOSIS OF DISEASES The Samhita gives directions for the diagnosis of a large number of diseases from a consideration of their etiology, symptoms and prognosis. It also contains an exposition of the general theory and methods of diagnosis. According to Caraka, there are three means open to the physician for ascertaining the nature of any sickness. They are: (2) theoretical knowledge of the possible causes and symptoms of all known diseases, (1) meticulous observation of the patient’s symptoms and complaints, (17) inferences based on previous experience. In the absence of one or more of the three aids to diagnosis, or with their fragmentary or incorrect knowledge, the physician cannot come to a true conclusion (V1. 4, 3-5). At another place Caraka again states that the three methods for the ascertainment of the nature of diseases are: niddna (cause and effect relation), piirvariipa (invariable prognostication), and upasaya and anupasaya (concomitant variation) (Mi. 1, 7, 8, 10). It is essential for the physician to have an exhaustive theoretical know 22 CARAKA SAMHITA ledge of the nature of all diseases—their specific sources, exciting factors, preliminary indications, bodily symptoms, local pains caused by them, possible complications and aggravations, degrees of severity, periods of duration, and indications of recovery and convalescence. By interrogation and by the application of his own trained senses the physician should conduct a detailed examination of the patient’s appearance, voice, abnormalities, intestinal and other internal sounds, blood and other body-fluids, and bodily excretions. If necessary, he should draw a sample of the patient’s blood and test it by offering it to a dog or a crow. He should also gather all possible information regarding the digestion, bowel movement, vitality, acuteness of sensory perceptions, clarity of mind, memory, psychic condition, irregularities of behaviour, dreams, aversions, hankerings and complaints of the patient. Latent symptoms, if any, should be tested by provocative medication. Only then he can make a diagnosis of the ailment, determine the expectation of recovery or imminence of death, and decide upon a course of treatment (Vi. 4, 6-9). It has been emphasized that fever is the first symptom ofall diseases (Ni. 1, 16). Diseases can be mild or severe. The preliminary symptoms are often the same.

Diseases can be mild or severe. The preliminary symptoms are often the same. In fact, the behaviour, bodily appearance and apparent vitality of the patient may sometimes give false indications. It is casy for the inexperienced physician to jump to conclusions on insufficient or misleading evidence. A mild palliative prescribed for a disease which is destined to become serious, or a strong medicine for a mild variety, may cause considerable injury to the patient; even death may result. Mere identification of a disease does not mean its diagnosis; it is absolutely necessary to foresee its possible course and severity (V1. 7, 2, 3, 5, 7). Some diseases are incurable and are known as such by their peculiar symptoms; such symptoms often indicate the period the patient will survive (Ni. 1, 6; In. Chap. 6 & 7). Some diseases are secondary, being caused by others occurring earlier. They may occur after the original malady subsides, or may run simultaneously with the later phase of the primary disease (NV. 8, 20-23). In diagnosis the patient’s personal history and background are of great importance. Residents of different countries are used to different diets, have different habits, and differ in physical fitness and mental inclinations. Hence, what is wholesome and normal for one type of people may have opposite effects on another. The liability to diseases of a person depends upon his place of birth, normal place of residence and accidental presence in a foreign country (V1. 8, 93). The patient’s nature, abnormalities, vitality, physical build, bodily proportions, physical equilibrium, psychic condition, capacity for food, capacity for physical exercise, and age — all are important factors in diagnosis (V2, 8, 94). METHODS OF TREATMENT, INCLUDING SURGERY 23 If the body-elements are individually healthy and collectively in harmony vith each other, the patient is highly resistant to diseases and specially to liseases of the severe type (Vi. 8, 111). He is also not easily affected by nile decay. The opposite is true for people with unhealthy and unbalanced »ody-elements (Vi. 8, 112). In addition to these extreme cases, there arc ilso intermediate types (Vz. 8, 113). VIII.

METHODS OF TREATMENT, INCLUDING SURGERY Different types of methods for the treatment of diseases have been described by Caraka, as follows: (1) Oral medication by single or compounded medicinal substances; sometimes more than fifty in a prescription are listed. Special emphasis is laid on diet, considered an essential part of the treatment (Sa Chap. 5, 6, 25, 26, 27). Purgation and/or cmesis 1s frequently recommended for cleansing the system of accumulated waste materials. Apart from drugs, purging is also effected by enemas (Ci. Chap. 7, 13, etc.; $2, Chap. 9-12). (2) (a) Eye-drops and -salves for eye diseases and loss of visual power (Sa. 5, 18, etc.). (b) Gargles for diseascs of the mouth, throat, teeth and gums (Sa. 5, 78, 79, etc.). (c) Medicinal cigars and smoking mixtures for affections of the head, nose, throat and bronchial tract (Sa. 5, 24, etc.), (d) Nasal medication in the form of powders, ointments, or inhaled fumes for psychic disorders, fainting fits, and affections of the nose (Sa. 5, 13, 14, etc.). In epilepsy and insanity, herbs and animal substances are burnt for inhalation (Cz. Ghap. 10). (3) Liquid unguents, creams, salves, ointments, lotions and medicated oils for the skin and other parts (Ci. Chap. 6, 7, etc.). (4) Suppositories, tampons, and soaked cotton swabs for car-passages and lower orifices of the body (Ci. Chap. 7, 8, etc.). (5) Enemas of nutritive and healing fluid-mixtures for absorption in the rectal and vaginal passages in wasting diseases, debility and fractures ($1. Chap. 3, 5, 12, etc.). (6) Douches for flushing the rectal, vaginal and urethral passages and for relieving congestion (S# Chap. 9, 10, etc.). Douche cans, tubes, and catheters, made of gold, silver or alloys, were used for this purpose (Sa 1, 44, 45, etc.). (7) Sweating the body surface by sun-bath, heated air, steam, or contact with hot surfaces for cleansing the system of absorbed impurities; sudation by steaming decoctions of medicinal 24 CARAKA SAMHITA substances, vapours, fomentation, poultices, solid lumps of medicinal matter and hot immersion bath (Sa.

Ghap. 9). The use of live ants of the big variety to grip together and hold tight the skin-flaps after an internal operation has been described (Ci. 13, 190 e¢ seqg.). The ants were killed by hot water and cut in two, with their gripping jaws left behind. (11) Psychiatric methods for curing mental conditions (Vi. Chap. 6). In the treatment of all diseases the physician should take care to perform the following preparatory processes: purification (purgation, emesis, etc.), tranquilization (use of sedatives) of the system, and avoidance of all causative factors (Vi. 8, 30). IX. POISONS The Caraka Samhité includes a detailed discussion of the various categories of poisons and the means by which they enter the human system; their symptoms, effects and antidotes are also described. The venoms secreted by animals, reptiles, aquatic creatures and insects are conveyed by their bites. They generally act very rapidly causing burning sensation, inflammation, swelling, drowsiness, fainting and diarrhoea. The symptoms are more pronounced in the lower extremities of the body (Ci. 10, 15, 17, 23). Poisons from vegetable roots and bulbs, mineral poisons and artificially prepared poisons enter the human body through foods, beverages, water, smoke, vapours, skin-applications, or by mere contact (Ci, 23, 106-122). Such poisons act slowly and cause fever, spasms, throat contraction, muscular rigidity, partial paralysis, frothy salivation and vomiting. The symptoms are more pronounced in the upper parts of the body (Ci. 23, 16-17). The toxic effects are liable to be mistaken for diseases (Ci. 23, 18). They vitiate the blood and other body-elements progressively; eight distinct stages with increasingly graver symptoms have been noted (Ci. 23, 14).

They vitiate the blood and other body-elements progressively; eight distinct stages with increasingly graver symptoms have been noted (Ci. 23, 14). Death may be caused by poisoning in the absence of proper treatment (Ci. 23, 31). PHYSICOCHEMICAL PROCESSES 25 Treatment for poisoning consists in the immediate application of stimulants to protect the heart, followed by incision, tourniquets, ligatures, suction, blood-letting, application of freshly cut meat, oral medicines and counterpoisons, according to the’ nature of the texic substance (Ci, 23, 35-50). For poisoning through food, drinks, etc., the immediate treatment is emesis (Cz. 23, 122). A description of the distinctive symptoms of bites by ten types of snakes (cobra, viper, etc.), mosquitoes, poisonous flies, hornets, spiders, scorpions, lizards, rats, crabs, toads (Ci. 23, 124-158), dogs and some predatory animals (Ci. 23, 175, 220-232) is found in the text with specific antidotes for individual cases. The medicinal value of venoms and vegetable poisons were known in Caraka’s time. They are described to have antagonistic effects in the presence of each other (Ci. 23, 17). A significant passage states that even deadly poisons can be converted into excellent medicines by the right method of application (Sa. 1, 126). Fumigation from vegetable and animal substances has been described as an antidote for most poisons (C7. 23, 99). The insecticidal and vermicidal action of fumigation were also recognized and several recipes given for the purpose (C7, 23, 98-100). X. PHYSICOCHEMICAL PROCESSES Many of the common laboratory processes known today are found in the Caraka Samhita. They occur in various passages which give instructions for compounding medicinal preparations (Cz. Chap. 1, 2, 15, ctc.). A list of terms for such processes is given in Table 17, Actual weights of the various ingredients of prescriptions are given in many cases; volumes are given in some instances. The tuld (balance) was used for weighing, and mdnabhdndas (measuring vessels) for measuring liquids (Sd. 15, 7). A list of the apparatus, mentioned in the various processes, is given in Table 16. Descriptions of the following processes are given in some detail: (1) A flame test for food-poisons (possibly copper salts), where the flame shows a colour like the feathers of a peacock (Ci. 23, 109).

(4) A process for continuous extraction of the fatty matter present in a plant product by repeated distillation with a volatile oil, followed by its condensation (Vi. 7, 22). 26 CARAKA SAMHITA For the purpose of heating, wood and the dried cakes of vgrious animal dungs were used according to the temperature required (Ct. Chap. 1, 2, 15, etc.). The mechanical processes mentioned are listed ‘in Table 18. XI, CLASSIFICATIONS Vibhagavidya (Vi. 4, 4), or the theory of classification, is a feature of the Caraka Samhita. Many substances and phenomena are divided into rational groups. (1) The days of the Samvatsara (solar year) are divided into : (a) Udakayana (period of absorption of moisture) (b) Daksindyana or Visarga (period of liberation of moisture). Each of these periods is sub-divided into three seasons (Sa. 6, 4).
